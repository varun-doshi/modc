# ModC : Rust Implementation of Finite Field Arithmetic

### Warning: This is strcitly for learning purposes and currently should not be used in any production environment

#### Check [next branch](https://github.com/varun-doshi/modc/tree/next) for a more generalized library. New updates will be pushed to this branch first

ModC is an ongoing Finite Field Implementation in Rust. 

### Current Finite Field Operations implemented:
- Addition
- Subtration
- Multiplication
- Division
- Additive Inversion
- Multiplicative Inversion
- Self Moduli
- Power
